### What is this?
As most students do, I found myself not being as productive as I should be and decided to try out the classic Pomodoro technique. While experimenting with this popular productivity method, I found that it was not very effective for me as I would either get distracted before the timer ran out or want to continue working even after the timer ran out. Around this time, I came across a TikTok made by a student in medical school (I will link it here if I end up finding it again) in which he described his method for productivity. In essence, it was a reversal of the Pomodoro technique; you time yourself working for however long you want and your break time is calculated as a ratio of time worked (the TikTok divided time worked by 5). I thought that this was a great idea and decided to start using it and it worked wonders for me. 

For this reason, instead of manually timing and dividing, I decided to create this web application (mobile application coming soon?) that would do this grunt work for me. 

This specific application is technically version 2 of the Flowmodoro application that I created about a year ago. The reason for creating it all over again was because I wanted to implement a to-do list that would be persisted as well as implement some new technologies that I wanted to learn such as Node.js, Express, GraphQL and MongoDB. The previous version was a static site created with vanilla HTML/CSS and JS.
